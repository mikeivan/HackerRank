## Java Dequeue

[Link to challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-dequeue)

### What I learned
- Java Dequeue - like a stack connected to a queue

### Difficulties
Figuring out how to use the Dequeue to solve this problem. I think a simple Queue would have worked also,
since I only added to the end and popped from the front. Also, figuring out a way to keep track of 
unique numbers, but HashSet took care of that.

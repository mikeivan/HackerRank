[Link to challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-annotations)

### What I learned
- Java Annotations

### Method
Create a budgetLimit variable in the interface. Fill in the checks in main.
Create annotations for the two methods with default values.

### Difficulties
Figuring out what is going on and what is being asked.

### Thoughts/Notes
Wrapping my head around creating meta-data for methods is weird. Not sure how
useful this could be.

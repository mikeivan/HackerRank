## Java Singleton Pattern

[Link to challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-singleton)

### What I learned
- Nothing new.

### Method
Create the class exactly like it's described. Have to keep a static variable as the one
instance of the class.

### Difficulties
None.

### Thoughts/Notes
Perhaps checking in the constructor if instance == null and then creating a new Singleton()
is a better method than calling the constructor in the declaration.

## Prime Checker

[Link to challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/prime-checker)

### What I learned
- Nothing new.

### Method
Create a function with varargs to check if each number is a prime.
I checked prime the manual way, using something like isProbablePrime might have
been better.

Also had to import static System.in to handle the intentional bug.

### Difficulties
Figuring out InputStreamReader(in) was referring to System.in
